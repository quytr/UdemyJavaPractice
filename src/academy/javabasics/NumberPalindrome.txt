Imagine we gave this function number 2465 as an argument.
int lastDigit = number % 10; stores the last digit (number 5) in the lastDigit variable.
number is still 2465

Now we enter the loop:

while (number > 9) {
number /= 10;
}
Loop 1: number is 2465 - it's greater than 9 so we take the last digit off with number /= 10;

Loop 2: number is now 246 - it's greater than 9 so we take the last digit off with number /= 10;

Loop 3: number is now 24 - it's greater than 9 so we take the last digit off with number /= 10;
Loop 4: number is now 2 - it's not greater than 9 so we exit the loop

2 is the first digit of the number, which we need.

As long as number is greater than 9 that means number has at least 2 digits left and we need to keep looping and take
the digits off until we are left with number which is less or equal to 9.
Once number is less or equal to 9, that means we got the first digit of the number.
